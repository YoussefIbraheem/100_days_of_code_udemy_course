# 🎮 Python Mini Projects – 100 Days of Code

This is a personal collection of interactive Python apps built as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Python" course.

## Projects Built So Far (27% Complete)
- 🃏 Blackjack Game – Terminal-based logic with randomized card drawing
- ☕ Coffee Machine Simulator – Tracks ingredients, handles transactions, simulates machine behavior
- 🐢 Turtle Race Betting – Color-based turtle race animation with betting logic
- 🎨 Hirst Painting Generator – Uses `turtle` graphics and RGB color mode to generate art
- 🤖 Quiz Game – User input, scoring system, and replay loop
- 🔢 Number Guessing Game – Terminal-based input validation and loop control

## Skills Applied
- Python 3, OOP, procedural logic
- Randomness, loops, conditionals
- CLI interfaces and basic GUIs (`turtle` module)
- Code readability and function breakdown

## What’s Next?
Currently working through the course and planning to build:
- Flask-based web APIs
- Data automation projects
- Integration with OpenAI APIs for AI-based tools
